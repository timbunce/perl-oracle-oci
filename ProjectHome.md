The Oracle::OCI perl module is a thin layer over the Oracle OCI client library.

It's goal is to make the entire OCI API available to Perl, thereby also making available all the advanced functionality offered by OCI.

It integrates well with Perl DBI, allowing DBD::Oracle handles to be used wherever appropriate.
